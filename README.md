# Generic-BST-with-Iterator-class
Generic BST implementation with iterator class:
Here is an implementation of a generic BST which stores generic key and value data and it does so by applying the user defined predicate function on the key field of data.
A short description about all the files is given as folows:-
bstree.cpp: contains implementation of BSTree class, 
bstree.hpp: contains interface of BSTree class, 
client1.cpp: contains class declaration with primitive datatype and less predicate along with functions, 
client2.cpp: contains class declaration with user defined datatype and greater predicate along with functions, 
client3.cpp: contains class declaration with user defined datatype and less predicate along with functions, 

To execute type the following command: g++ -std=c++11 -o objectfile_name clientfile.cpp bstree.cpp
